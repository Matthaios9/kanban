StudyBuddy is an online web application that aims to connect students with tutors, 
addressing various concerns prevalent in the education industry. These concerns include 
the high cost of tuition, the absence of round-the-clock support, the scarcity of 
dependable tutors and the lack of interactive learning options which was discussed in the 
earlier section. To tackle the issue of expensive tuition, StudyBuddy offers an affordable 
solution by facilitating connections between students and qualified tutors through an 
online platform.

StudyBuddy recognizes the need for constant support that aligns with the diverse 
schedules of students. Unlike traditional tutoring services with limited availability, 
StudyBuddy ensures round-the-clock assistance by providing a platform where students 
can seek help at any time. Additionally, the platform strives to address the challenge of 
finding reliable tutors by creating a pool of qualified professionals with verified 
credentials, ensuring students have access to trustworthy and competent guidance.

Furthermore, StudyBuddy acknowledges that existing alternatives like textbooks or static 
online resources lack interactivity, hindering students' learning experiences. In response, 
StudyBuddy offers an interactive platform where students can post questions, receive 
answers, engage in private messaging and even have video chat sessions with tutors. This 
approach fosters a dynamic learning environment and enriches the overall educational 
journey.
